# Using App

# Technologies Used
• Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
• React-Icons used for Icons

# Future Directions
For a bigger challenge or more customization, try one of the following modifications:
---easy---
• replace the cat pictures with dog pictures
• add a randomizer so some proportion of swipe-rights don't result in a match 
• add functionality to the 'back' button
--medium--
• add a 'profile' button to add a picture/info for your own cat
• add the 'swipe' animation effect to the left/rigt button presses
---hard---
• add chat functionality for the cats to the messages section, using a chatbot 
• add functionality to recognize cat face and align picture with cat's face centered in the middle
